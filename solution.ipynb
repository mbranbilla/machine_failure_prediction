    "\n",
    "To enable the operations of an FPSO, we use sensors to make sure the equipment does not fail. These sensors measure different parameters of the equipment in different setup configurations (preset 1 and preset 2) over time. We want you to investigate one piece of equipment in different time cycles to understand what characteristics and parameters of the sensors might indicate that the equipment is on the verge of failing. To solve this problem, we expect you to answer a few questions regarding the attached dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 – Calculate how many times the equipment has failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2 – Categorize equipment failures by setups configurations (preset 1 and preset 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    3 – Categorize equipment failures by their nature/root cause according to parameter readings (temperature, pressure, and others).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4 – Create a model using the technique you think is most appropriate and measure its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5 – Analyze variable importance.\n",

    "**Few Tips:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please write down any insights and conclusions throughout your code when you think it is necessary, keeping them as clear and complete as possible. Think of this exercise as your first technical report for Shape!\n",
    "At Shape, we generally work with Python, and you are encouraged to use this language. However, if you can't use Python, you can use R or Julia for this assessment. We value clean, concise, and production-ready code.\n",
    "Once you’re done, please send us your analyses and answers in an Html notebook, but also other conclusions and insights that you think are relevant to the project. We value creativity!\n",
    "Feel free to discuss how you think you would put the models in production.\n",
